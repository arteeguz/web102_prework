## Notes

Challenges encountered during the project included mastering JavaScript's array manipulation methods like filter, reduce, and understanding DOM manipulation for dynamically updating the webpage. Implementing the sorting algorithm for the top funded games and ensuring the grammatical accuracy of dynamically generated text were also complex tasks.
